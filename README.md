Hey there 👋,

My name is André Jesus, but my friends call me Jesus😃. 
I'm a software engineering student in Portugal, currently looking to learn more about programming and software development. 
I mostly code in Kotlin📱, but sometimes I also do some Python🐍 projects.

On my profile you can find some of the small projects I've developed since I started this journey to become the best software developer I can be 👌.

You also can check my [Website🌐](https://sites.google.com/view/andre-jesus) and [LinkedIn🔗](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-jesus-engineering).
