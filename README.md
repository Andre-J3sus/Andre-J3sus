Hey there 👋,

My name is André Jesus, but my friends call me Jesus😃. 
I'm a Software Engineering student in Portugal, currently looking to learn more about programming and software development.
I'm studying at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/en/) taking the Bachelor in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.

I mainly code in Kotlin📱 and JavaScript🌐, but I'm always open to learning new languages and technologies.

On my profile you can find some small projects I've developed since I started this journey to become the best software developer I can be 👌.

You also can check my [Website🌐](https://sites.google.com/view/andre-jesus) and [LinkedIn🔗](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-jesus-engineering).
